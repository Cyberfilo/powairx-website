        <h2>What is STEM Racing?</h2>
        <p>
            STEM Racing is a school project where students use science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to design and build small, high-performance racing cars. The goal is to think and work like real engineers: creating 3D models, testing aerodynamic ideas, improving designs, and aiming for the best possible performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each team functions like an actual racing organization. Every member has a clear role, decisions come from testing and data, and the final car is judged on speed, design quality, and teamwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project teaches practical skills you keep long-term. You learn how engineering tools work, how to solve problems without giving up, and how to communicate and plan with a team. Presenting your work builds confidence, and dealing with deadlines prepares you for future studies and real-world projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>
            Our team started with something that already made us different: we come from
            different countries and backgrounds, and we brought that mix of ideas into
            everything we built. Being an international team helped us look at problems
            from different perspectives and work in a way that felt creative and open.
            Last year we entered the competition as the youngest team, but that didn’t stop
            us from pushing hard and aiming high. We learned how to manage our time,
            handle pressure, and improve our engineering and aerodynamic skills with
            every test and redesign. Even with our lack of experience, we proved that age
            wasn’t a barrier.

            Our effort paid off when we won the Enterprise Award, showing that our
            planning, teamwork, and professional approach stood out. That moment
            became a turning point for us. It showed that we could compete with older
            teams, stay focused under pressure, and present ourselves at a high level.
